## If dependency error do the following:
`expo install`


* This should install any dependencies in the program.
* Must use **`expo install`** not npm nor yarn. It will cause issues. 
 

### If this does not work:
* The following libraries are used
  *  `expo install @react-native-picker`
  *  `expo install @react-native-community/datetimepicker`

Install 
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install mariadb
Let Kristen know if it doesn't work
